## Welcome


<img src="assets/images/owasp_gaurella_logo.png">

OWASP Gaurella Chapter is a community-driven initiative established to promote awareness, education, and best practices in application security across Gaurella and nearby regions of Chhattisgarh. The chapter serves as a platform for students, developers, cybersecurity professionals, researchers, and technology enthusiasts to collaborate and grow together.

The chapter conducts meetups, workshops, webinars, hands-on sessions, and knowledge-sharing events focused on application security, secure coding, cloud security, DevSecOps, and emerging cybersecurity threats. OWASP Gaurella aligns itself with OWASP’s global mission to make software security visible and accessible to everyone.

## Participation
